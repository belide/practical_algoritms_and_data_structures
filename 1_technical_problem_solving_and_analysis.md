# Techical Problem Solving and Analysis

## In this class I will learn algorithmic analysis with Big O notation.

### Pre-class

* Read George Polya's [How to Solve It](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf) chapter 1.
  * 4 Principles of problem solving:
    1. Understand the problem
      * Do I understand all the words in the problem?
      * What am I being asked to find or show?
      * Can I restate the problem?
      * Will drawing a diagram help?
      * Is there enough info to solve problem?
    2. Devise a plan
      * There are many ways to solve a problem. Strategies include:
        * Guess and check
        * Orderly list
        * Eliminate possibilities
        * Look for patterns
    3. Carry out the plan
      * Need care and patience. Persist with the plan I have chosen. If the plan does not work then discard it and choose a different plan.
    4. Look back
      * Much can be gained by looking back and taking time to reflect on what I've done, what worked, and what didn't.
